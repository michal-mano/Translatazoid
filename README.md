# Translatazoid

Translatazoid is a Chrome extension that allows you to translate highlighted text between chosen languages. With Translatazoid, you can easily translate any text you encounter while browsing the web.

### How it works
Translatazoid works by integrating with the Chrome browser. Once you install the extension, you can select the source language and the destination language using the extension's popup. Then, whenever you highlight text on a web page, a textbox will appear with the translation.

### Features
* Simple and easy-to-use interface
* Ability to translate text (including sentences) between any two languages
* Ability to easily change the source and destination languages
* No need to leave the current web page to translate text


### Limitations and known issues
* Translatazoid may not work properly on some web pages with complex layouts or non-standard HTML.
* The quality of translations depends on the translation engine used by the extension, which is provided by a third-party service.
* Some languages may not be supported by the translation engine.
* Feature for the future - ability to choose if the translation pops up whenever text is highlighted or only when "CTRL" is pressed
